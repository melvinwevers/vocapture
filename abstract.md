The Dutch East India Company (_Verenigde Oost-Indisch Compagnie, VOC_), founded in 1602, was the largest employer in the Dutch Republic. The VOC kept detailed salary records of its seamen and soldiers who mustered for a journey to Asia and back---given that they did not die during the long voyage or ashore in Asia. The VOC and its predecessors sailed out for 4,787 times between 1595 and 1794. The ledgers from 3,248 outward journeys have survived, mostly including records from the 18<sup>th</sup> century. These ledgers contain 774,200 muster records, which contain the names, rank, place of birth, and date of sailing. Volunteers working for the National Archives of the Netherlands manually entered these records into a database called [VOCOP dataset](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/index/nt00444?activeTab=nt). Historians, social scientists, and genealogists have used the records in their research. 

While the database contains an sizeable amount of data over a long period of time, we also know that about 32 percent of the records have been lost. It is clear that this impacts analysis of the data and hampers its representative. We know that data has been lost and in which periods there is more missing data. However, we do not know whether factors such as rank or origin impacted the loss of these records. In other words, did the VOC pay more attention to carefully log and archive records of high-ranking officials than those of sailors from the Baltic area? Also, if there is an effect of rank or origin did this fluctuate over time, possibly relating to periods of social unrest? 

Migrant workers played a key role in the Dutch economy in the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> century. Between 1650 and 1750 the share of foreign workers fluctuated between 30 and 20 percent. Yet, if we want to properly analyse their impact on the Dutch republic's economy, or their career perspectives in the VOC, we need to be better informed about whether position or origin affected the survival of records. 

In this paper, we apply capture / recapture models to determine how many VOC contracts survived. Moreover, we examine whether there are (temporal) biases related to rank and origin. Capture / recapture models are used in ecology to estimate population sizes given a biased set of observations.
